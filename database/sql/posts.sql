	(1, '\'Metroid Dread\' is a thrilling twist on a classic, but it made me miserable', 'Games don\'t have to be grueling to be great.', '<p>It&#39;s not that&nbsp;<em>Metroid Dread</em>&nbsp;is a bad video game. I just never want to touch it again. If masochistically punishing games aren&#39;t your thing, I&#39;d strongly recommend avoiding it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In every way, the latest side-scrolling adventure for intergalactic bounty hunter Samus Aran is faithful to the spirit of its predecessors. In fact, this new story is a straight-up continuation of the narrative that the original game kicked off.&nbsp;<em>Dread</em>, like the Metroids that came before it, sets our armored heroine loose in a sprawling complex of corridors, ducts, and chambers, with most of those locations sealed off behind obstacles that can only be circumvented using one tool or another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of those tools are, of course, locked behind fearsome boss fights and other threats. Most of the baddies can be defeated with Samus&#39;s trusty arm cannon and missiles, same as always. However, clearing the hazardous locales of planet ZDR, where&nbsp;<em>Dread</em>&nbsp;is set, is no easy task. Like every other side-scrolling Metroid game, this is a game of pattern memorization and recognition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enemies move and attack in predictable ways and they always appear in the same locations when you re-enter a room. Bosses work the same way, though they draw from a wider pool of attacks that are tougher to read and hit harder than your average alien murderbug. But whether it&#39;s an enemy-filled chamber you need to clear or a whole, entire boss, the expectation is the same: Throw Samus at the threat again and again to learn the patterns, master the timing, and persevere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s been the approach for Metroid games &mdash; and Metroid-<em>like</em>&nbsp;games, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/22/hollow-knight-review">the widely beloved&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/22/hollow-knight-review">Hollow Knight</a></em>&nbsp;&mdash; since the world first met Samus in 1986. The tricky part for the creators of these games is finding the line between satisfying challenge and punishing slog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="" src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01oZO3oSUwJFBIXRW2AJbAr/images-130.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1633525506.jpg" style="height:576px; width:1024px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, what qualifies as &quot;challenging&quot; is deeply subjective and influenced by everything from the underlying creative vision to the tastes of the would-be audience. But games always have the capacity to make compromises. Difficulty settings can make a tough game more approachable. Accessibility settings can make complex controls less of a burden for players who need (or even just want) an easier time. Games don&#39;t have to be grueling to be great. For a beloved elder franchise that has fans spanning multiple age groups, a high barrier to entry is a crushing disappointment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s where and why&nbsp;<em>Metroid Dread</em>&nbsp;is a resounding failure for me. You can&#39;t change the difficulty or make the experience more accessible. There are no compromises that might ease the pain of a particularly challenging encounter. If you get stuck on a boss for two hours, well, hopefully, you&#39;ll get a handle on it before the third hour passes. Or the fourth, or later. Because that&#39;s your only option!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comparing hard games to&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-dark-souls-of-x-its-just-like-dark-souls">may be a tired meme</a>&nbsp;at this point, but this is a case where the spirit of that meme actually applies. It&#39;s not that From Software&#39;s hit series is hard so much as it is uncompromising; you have to meet the Souls games and those like it on their terms. That&#39;s the case as well for developer MercurySteam&#39;s work on&nbsp;<em>Metroid Dread</em>: This is a hard game, yes, but it&#39;s a static challenge. You&#39;re either going to get it, or you won&#39;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The uncompromising approach extends beyond the moment-to-moment gameplay, too.&nbsp;<em>Metroid Dread</em>&nbsp;is incredibly vague about what you&#39;re supposed to do at any given moment. That&#39;s been a series trope for a long time with the side-scrolling Metroid games. But just because something is an established tradition that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the right idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I spent inordinate amounts of my time in&nbsp;<em>Dread</em>&nbsp;scanning around the massive and intricately detailed map screen, with its dozens of icons for phase beam doors, missile doors, morph ball launchers, speed boost blocks, and other interaction points that work with some specific tool or another. The trick to finding the way forward is to look at the last few tools you picked up and then scan the map for previously visited areas where there may be a door or path you couldn&#39;t open before, but now can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Dread</em>&nbsp;lets you highlight doors and blocks by &quot;type&quot; on the map, which makes it easier to find areas you haven&#39;t broken into yet. But that isn&#39;t terribly clear in-game until you start experimenting with the controls listed on the map screen. The map is also just extremely large and&nbsp;<em>dense</em>, with tiny, difficult-to-see details, even when you&#39;re zoomed in. (This right here is an extremely basic accessibility issue that could be solved with the addition of some basic display settings. There are none in&nbsp;<em>Metroid Dread</em>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, those tiny details are often where the path forward is found. Also, you&#39;re not choosing the doors or blocks you want to tag from a list; to use the &quot;highlight&quot; feature, you actually have to find one of whatever it is you want to tag on the map and&nbsp;<em>then</em>&nbsp;select it. So if you&#39;re already having a hard time locating a particular block or door, you&#39;re stuck. The feature isn&#39;t terribly helpful in those situations, and it doesn&#39;t remotely solve all of the pathfinding problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It did help me, though, especially after a friend and fellow critic suggested leaning on that tool&nbsp;<em>specifically</em>&nbsp;whenever I felt lost. I just don&#39;t understand why the game itself doesn&#39;t make the presence and use of the highlight feature more explicit during the early tutorial hours. It&#39;s a rare bit of help in a game that would seemingly rather just not offer any.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rigid design here is heartbreaking for me, not just as a longtime fan of Metroid but also as a lover of video games who sees all the wonderful new ideas MercurySteam injected into&nbsp;<em>Dread</em>. The biggest and coolest addition is a direct reflection of the subtitle. This Metroid&#39;s &quot;Dread&quot; is realized by seven hunting robots called EMMIs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These spindly terrors each behave a little differently from one another and occupy their own, specific &quot;EMMI zone&quot; areas of the map. You can&#39;t defeat them using conventional weapons, and being caught by one is almost always an immediate trip to the &quot;Game Over&quot; screen. So, most of the time evasion is your best bet for dealing with them. But that&#39;s difficult because every EMMI has a keen robot ear that picks up on Samus&#39;s movements when she&#39;s in their rather large detection range. They don&#39;t go into alert mode and seal off exits until they actually spot Samus, but the moment they hear her they&#39;ll rush in to investigate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like so much else in a Metroid game, each EMMI is a puzzle to be solved. You&#39;re taught early on that there&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a way to defeat them, but it&#39;s a different process for each one that always includes a miniboss fight and a (frequently tricky!) final tussle with the EMMI itself. Defeat one and you&#39;ll get a new tool for Samus, but even better: That particular EMMI zone gets permanently cleared, freeing you up to explore and hunt for secrets or new paths without the fear of an insta-fail haunting your every move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The addition of EMMIs really shakes up the typical flow of a Metroid game. It&#39;s still the same basic process of following roughly linear paths from one objective to the next, until you find a new tool that opens up more opportunities for free exploration &mdash; and, eventually, a new basically-linear route to your next objective. But more often than not, you&#39;ll find one or more EMMI zones that need to be passed through, and possibly dealt with, before you can reach Samus&#39;s next objective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s cool, new ideas like this that really make&nbsp;<em>Metroid Dread</em>&nbsp;a heartbreaker for me. I love the tension that EMMIs bring to the mix. It&#39;s plenty stressful to get a boss&#39;s health down low when Samus only has a sliver of energy left &mdash; and extremely satisfying when you survive in those circumstances &mdash; but the hunts are different. They&#39;re&nbsp;<em>tense</em>. Samus has ways to hide, like a limited-use cloaking ability, as well as tools in the environment that can cut off a pursuing EMMI, but they&#39;re all fallible. Make a mistake and you&#39;re toast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The penalty for failure, in the face of an EMMI or anything else, is generally mild, at least. Save locations are few and far between, but&nbsp;<em>Metroid Dread</em>&nbsp;is littered with invisible checkpoints. If an EMMI catches Samus, you&#39;re sent back to the last non-EMMI zone room you visited. If a boss fight goes poorly, Samus respawns only a short distance away, making the need to try and fail again and again a bit easier to swallow. However, generous checkpoints aren&#39;t a solution for the deeper issues here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s not one particular thing that broke&nbsp;<em>Metroid Dread</em>&#39;s spell for me. The real issue is how fundamentally&nbsp;<em>unfriendly</em>&nbsp;it is as an overall experience. It&#39;s challenging, but that challenge is a solid, vertical wall here. There&#39;s nothing in the way of help for players who can&#39;t climb that wall. You&#39;re expected to just be patient, keep trying, and, to borrow one of the more annoying gamer troll catchphrases, &quot;<em>get good</em>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&#39;t want to get the kind of good that&#39;s required here. I tried and it was deeply unpleasant. When I got stuck on a certain boss for multiple hours, so much frustration built up in my repeated attempts to beat it that there was no satisfaction when I finally succeeded. That was a recurring issue with boss fights, with pathfinding, and even with some of the later run-of-the-mill foes that you encounter. The more I played&nbsp;<em>Metroid Dread</em>, the less I wanted to keep playing. I didn&#39;t manage to finish in the end, and I&#39;m sure I never will.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s a damn shame. I love Metroid. I want to play all the Metroid and experience its whole story for myself. But MercurySteam decided, for whatever reason, that&nbsp;<em>only&nbsp;</em>those people who pass the test, who master the controls, who happily throw themselves at challenges again and again &mdash; who, to use that atrocious shorthand again,&nbsp;<em>get good</em>&nbsp;enough &mdash; can experience all the joys and wonders that&nbsp;<em>Metroid Dread</em>&nbsp;has to offer. What a waste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Metroid Dread is out for Nintendo Switch on Oct. 8.</em></p>\r\n', 'Gaming', '["gaming", "metroid"]', 'https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01oZO3oSUwJFBIXRW2AJbAr/hero-image.fill.size_1248x702.v1633525508.jpg', '2021-02-25 06:42:00'),

	(4, '\'Resident Evil 4\' in VR gets brief new gameplay teaser and release date', 'Terrifying stuff coming to Oculus Quest 2.', '<p>A virtual reality version of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>will launch October 21st on Facebook&rsquo;s Oculus Quest 2 headset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Resident Evil 4 VR</em>&nbsp;was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396528/capcom-resident-evil-4-oculus-quest-2-remake-trailer-footage-launch-date">announced earlier this year</a>. But Facebook and Capcom &mdash; as well as third-party development studio Armature &mdash; have only offered glimpses of its gameplay, including a short trailer. It adapts the original game&rsquo;s content with a (mostly) first-person point of view, re-engineering it to take advantage of VR motion controls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ryxX8RV3kXsXvBNuzFRVRJsW_dA=/0x0:2560x1440/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:2560x1440):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22880730/RE4_SCREENSHOTS_MENDEZ_SHOTGUN_003_2560X1440_Legal.jpg" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Armature&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>&nbsp;makes a somewhat complicated series of small changes the original 2005 horror game. It&rsquo;s supposed to feature the same narrative content and world design, rather than getting the kind of overhaul&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2</em>&nbsp;did in 2019. But it&rsquo;s been re-engineered to work as a first-person VR game with motion controllers. You&rsquo;ll interact with weapons, items, and puzzles using your hands. Your health will be visible on a wristwatch instead of a screen overlay. And in addition to moving with the analog stick on an Oculus Touch controller, you&rsquo;ll be able to teleport or walk in room-scale VR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new design could affect gameplay in some notable ways. You can wield weapons in each hand, for instance, and switching between them looks a lot easier. You&rsquo;ll use a knife by physically slashing your controller at enemies instead of hitting a button. And a gameplay video shows you moving around while shooting, a major change from the original design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game&rsquo;s not fully first-person, though. All its cutscenes will be presented in their original third-person format, including ones tied to&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;many quick time events, according to Facebook. Based on Facebook&rsquo;s description, the game features some surprisingly fast-sounding camera shifts &mdash; you can apparently kick a door down with a button, for instance, and see a short third-person animation as it opens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jUUN1PZ8Jo2axxzKAI6dsjvEYvM=/0x0:2560x1440/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:2560x1440):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22880733/RE4_SCREENSHOTS_CHURCH_PUZZLE_001_2560x1440_Legal.jpg" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook says the original quicktime event placements and animations are going to stay the same, although some of the actions have been &ldquo;updated&rdquo; to work better in VR. (We&rsquo;ll be waiting to see how the game&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fey8XU0OiWo">more acrobatic</a>&nbsp;sections translate to a headset.) Some of the quick time events will involve quickly moving the controllers, while others will ask you to pull their triggers at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other tweaks would make sense in any remaster. The game&rsquo;s textures have been updated, and Armature has made enemies less likely to target your partner Ashley, who you&rsquo;ll spend a lot of time protecting in either version of the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike most Quest games,&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4 VR</em>&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t compatible with the original 2019 Quest &mdash; it&rsquo;s completely exclusive to the 2020 Quest 2. Facebook also isn&rsquo;t sharing any potential plans to bring it to Oculus&rsquo; desktop platform, nor has it discussed the game coming to desktop PC or consoles, the way&nbsp;<em>Myst&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;Oculus Quest version&nbsp;<a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/myst-vr-remake-pc-vr-release-date/">later launched outside VR</a>.

He was a fan of my music, but he&#39;d also seen that I released a small RPG to help promote&nbsp;<em>Soft Sounds from Another Planet</em>&nbsp;and had done an&nbsp;<a href="http://polygon.com/features/2017/9/14/16298926/japanese-breakfast-interview-play-japanese-breakfquest-online-rpg" target="_blank">interview with Polygon</a>&nbsp;where I talked about my love of video games.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because she joined on<em>&nbsp;</em>so early in the development process, finding what&nbsp;<em>Sable</em>&#39;s score would sound like was a gradual process that required a lot of patience and small steps forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It started with just seeing the art and GIFs, and reading a Word document of what they imagined the game&#39;s different biomes would be like. And then the next year, it would be seeing actual clips and videos, and composing to that. The year after that, I finally started getting builds of the game once a week and playing through it, adding music throughout. So it&#39;s been a really, really long time coming.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zauner&#39;s history with gaming goes way back. &quot;I really love a lot of early RPG games,&quot; she said, citing&nbsp;<em>Secret of Mana&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Chrono Cross&nbsp;</em>as two of her childhood favorites. Her admiration for those games is due in part to their accompanying soundtracks, and they would eventually go on to inspire some of her work on&nbsp;<em>Sable</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It was really fun to make, like, variations on a theme. That&#39;s something that I think&nbsp;<em>Chrono Cross</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://mashable.com/article/breath-of-the-wild-quarantine-escapism" target="_blank">Breath of the Wild</a></em><em>&nbsp;</em>did really well, where there are daytime and nighttime variations of each song.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zauner says that finding small ways to manipulate established themes and create different feels for each of them was an invigorating experiment. &quot;That was a really fun thing that I never got to do before, where I could say &#39;Oh, it&#39;s nighttime, so I&#39;m going to take the same theme, and same instrumentation, and the same key, but I&#39;m going to slow it down by like 20 BPM and make it feel sparser.&#39; Or even making percussive elements a little bit softer and quieter to make it feel different from the daytime track.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="\'Sable\' is now out on Xbox and PC." src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02sNMc3xL5jPykXR9o7OHj6/images-77.png" style="height:576px; width:1024px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Sable&#39; is now out on Xbox and PC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Zauner is no stranger to making music as Japanese Breakfast, she admits that tackling a video game score is an entirely different beast that presents its own unique challenges. &quot;<em>Sable</em>&nbsp;is largely made up of instrumental and ambient songs, so they&#39;re the total opposite of a Japanese Breakfast song, which kind of operates within a pop structure where you&#39;re always trying to captivate a listener with a great hook.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Constructing a sonic identity for&nbsp;<em>Sable&nbsp;</em>wasn&#39;t about being catchy, though, she says. &quot;You want to have these like, really sprawling loops that don&#39;t take up too much of your attention, because you&#39;re hearing it so often and it would get super annoying to hear a repeating hook over and over.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even when Zauner does enter back into the lyrical realm in&nbsp;<em>Sable</em>, the approach still contrasted with how she would go about writing a song for a Japanese Breakfast album. &quot;Lyrically, this game has nothing to do with my personal life, whereas a lot of Japanese Breakfast songs are hyperpersonal and explore a lot of very detailed observations about me or investigate some sort of emotional trauma that I&#39;ve experienced.&nbsp;<em>Sable&nbsp;</em>had to be very broad and explore more universal, vague themes that didn&#39;t have a lot of detail yet, because a lot of the game&#39;s narrative was still getting worked on while I was composing for it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting involved so early in development also allowed Zauner the opportunity to help shape some of the game&#39;s bigger, show-stopping moments. &quot;One of the first references Gregorios and Daniel [<em>Sable</em>&#39;s two lead developers] mentioned was the scene in&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption</em>&nbsp;where&nbsp;<a href="https://pk.mashable.com/video/11889/netflixs-bloody-squid-game-trailer-puts-a-deadly-twist-on-schoolyard-games" target="_blank">the Jos&eacute; Gonz&aacute;lez track</a>&nbsp;comes on as you&#39;re heading to a town and you&#39;re riding on your horse.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s when Zauner knew that she wanted&nbsp;<em>Sable&nbsp;</em>to have a moment of similar scope, which would become the game&#39;s post-tutorial opening that releases players into an open world to the tune of standout single, &quot;Glider.&quot; It&#39;s the perfect introduction to hold your hand as you, the curious traveler, begin to cross&nbsp;<em>Sable</em>&#39;s expansive sands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hand-holding is something that Zauner&#39;s score does a lot in&nbsp;<em>Sable</em>, and it&#39;s vital to the experience. It&#39;s a game that, for long stretches of time, forces you to be alone as you traverse liminal salt flats and empty plains. That might sound boring, maybe even frightening to some, but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s actually beautiful, thanks not only to&nbsp;<em>Sable</em>&#39;s gorgeous art style, but also to what you hear as you trek through its many spaces. The game&#39;s score is a presence that&#39;s always guiding you, and a reminder that soon you&#39;ll happen upon something magnificent. It&#39;s a comforting hand on your shoulder, telling you to keep going when you feel like you might be the only person roaming this strange, lonely world anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zauner made that a reality by carefully considering the instruments and tones that would accompany each area of the game, developing distinct personalities that set one apart from the next. &quot;I knew that I wanted the camps in each biome to have a warm, homey feel to them. I felt like more analog instruments would work better for those areas, so every time you hit a camp I&#39;m using a Nylon string guitar. But in the Badlands, you&#39;ll hear super reverb-ed out electric guitars, and more woodwind instruments when you come across the open dunes. It was all about the feel I wanted each area to evoke in terms of instrumentation and what kind of chord changes they needed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe width="922" height="528" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ej5-CHAGr34" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Sable</em>&#39;s remarkable visual identity helped to inform what exactly the &quot;feel&quot; for each area would be. &quot;There are a lot of different eras at play in&nbsp;<em>Sable</em>&#39;s world. Like, there&#39;s a lot of really organic flora and fauna that you&#39;ll see, and then there are also these sort of industrial ships and types of sci-fi technology.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zauner kept that in mind as she composed the game&#39;s 32 different arrangements. &quot;[The dev team] talked a lot about those &#39;eras&#39; within the game. The &#39;atomic era&#39; is the more industrial stuff, so I knew I wanted to use an instrumental palette that felt more futuristic. Then there&#39;s also the &#39;monumental era&#39; that feels very ancient and has a lot of history, so I incorporated more organic choir samples and woodwinds into those moments.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some composers, creating a musical arrangement starts with a foundation in theory. Zauner confesses that the technical stuff isn&#39;t her biggest strength. &quot;I think so much of it is like, intuition. I watched these&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/8bitMusicTheory" target="_blank">8-bit Music Theory</a>&nbsp;videos on YouTube, which are all about the theory behind why certain sounds and chords make you feel tension and other emotions. But I also was talking to Aaron Maine of&nbsp;<a href="https://porchesmusic.com/" target="_blank">Porches</a>&nbsp;about this, and he was like, &#39;or sometimes you just find a &#39;spooky chord.&#39;&#39; I feel like I don&#39;t have a tremendous knowledge of musical theory, and as much as I wish I did, a lot of the time it was just about coming across that &#39;spooky chord.&#39;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Sable&nbsp;</em>has been in the works for many years, and it&#39;s finally out on the heels of two of Zauner&#39;s biggest undertakings to date. She says that it&#39;s an amazing feeling, even though it wasn&#39;t necessarily the plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s really surreal. I mean, I feel like people are really fed up with me because I&#39;ve had so many major releases this year already, but like, I&#39;ve been working on all of these projects for the past&nbsp;<em>five years</em>&nbsp;and I didn&#39;t anticipate them all coming out at the same time! I kind of wish it was more spread out, but it&#39;s such a new, exciting medium for me and I&#39;m really excited for people to finally experience what I&#39;ve experienced; to see what we&#39;ve made with&nbsp;<em>Sable</em>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked if scoring for a game is something she would be open to doing again, Zauner&#39;s answer was a resounding &quot;yes.&quot; &quot;I&#39;m really looking forward to people just seeing my capabilities as a composer, because I don&#39;t know if many people see me that way. Hopefully, I&#39;ll get another job!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/sable-review/" target="_blank">initial</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/sable/sable-review-captivating-gameplay-behind-a-beautiful-mask" target="_blank">reactions</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>Sable&nbsp;</em>are anything to go off of, it&#39;s all but certain that we&#39;ll get another Japanese Breakfast-scored title in the future.

The virtual museum, at the time of its launch, currently holds 12 art pieces within its digital confines. This includes 2D images and videos, and 3D interactive objects and experiences. A collective of artists and engineers came together to design the space. MoDaL is thus a blend of the artistic and the technological, in one virtual environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>"Digital art and NFTs have an enormous undiscovered potential, so in creating MoDaL, we wanted to show that by pushing the limits of both technology and artistic expression," says Darian Skarica, Delta Reality\'s founder. "Our goal was to show just how vast the scope of digital art is. That is also why we created it as an NFT of MoDaL, to make sure it has life of its own and grows with every change of hands".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The "growth" stems from a fundamental feature of MoDaL: it\'s an ever-evolving space, one that will continuously fleshed out with new works of art, animations, and environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first glance, the museum is truly a digital haven. There\'s a contemporary minimalist aesthetic, compounded by glowing forests, integrated gardens, and polychromatic works of animation — a pretty far cry from the museums most of us are used to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you buy the museum, you would have access to all the project files, assets, and codes within MoDaL. The future owner won\'t be able to autonomously modify or add onto the metaverse, but have the chance to do so with Delta Reality. A chain of collaboration will occur with each sell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what can you do inside? Well, the digital museum functions as a space that can be explored at will.

GM estimates the new version will cover 95 percent of all driving scenarios, including parking in driveways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GM didn&#39;t list which vehicles would have Ultra Cruise available on 2 million miles of road with the 2023 launch, but said the first car to include the system will be a Cadillac. By 2022, Super Cruise is supposed to be on 22 vehicles across the GM lineup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, GM plans to grow the Ultra Cruise coverage zone to 3.4 million miles. Super Cruise currently works on about 200,000 miles of highways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the addition of surface streets, Ultra Cruise will look a lot more like&nbsp;<a href="https://mashable.com/article/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-opens-to-all-customers">Tesla&#39;s latest Autopilot update, Full Self-Driving mode</a>.

Unlike the Flights page, though, you&#39;ll have to dig a bit deeper: click &quot;Learn more,&quot; tap &quot;Overview,&quot; and scroll down. Not all hotels provide such details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re also helping people make more sustainable choices when they shop, starting with home appliances,&quot; Pichai says. &quot;When you search for energy-intensive products like furnaces, dishwashers, or water heaters, suggestions in the Shopping tab will help narrow your search to cost-effective and sustainable options.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Clean Home Energy&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The electricity powering our homes comes from different sources based on the time of day &mdash;typically a mix of clean (solar and wind farms) and fossil fuel-based (gas and coal) energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nest thermostat users, however, can take advantage of Google&#39;s new&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/nest-renew-clean-energy">Nest Renew feature, Energy Shift</a>, which automatically converts heating and cooling electricity usage to times when energy is cleaner or less expensive. It can also adjust your thermostat&#39;s schedule to run more efficiently in summer and winter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The basic Nest Renew plan is available for free across the continental U.S. Eco warriors can pay $10 a month for a Renew Premium subscription, which matches your estimated fossil fuel electricity use at home with renewable energy credits from solar and wind plants.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Navigation</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting today (and in Europe next year), Google Maps will let you choose the most fuel-efficient driving route &mdash; if it isn&#39;t already the fastest one. The company estimates this could save more than one million tons of annual carbon emissions &mdash; &quot;the equivalent of removing over 200,000 cars from the road,&quot;&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/3-new-ways-navigate-more-sustainably-maps">according to Pichai</a>. It would also save drivers money by reducing fuel consumption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Of course, the most sustainable choice often doesn&#39;t involve a car at all,&quot; he adds.

These letters examine what the world could look like then — and how we can make the best scenario happen.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Dear 22nd Century,</p><p>If you still have such a thing as a doctor’s office, it might look something like the one I walked into in San Francisco the other week — one with no paperwork, no tablets, no visible computers at all. Instead, at a five-year-old startup called Forward Health, a doctor asked questions for nearly two hours in front of a giant touchscreen with a model of my body. We covered the interconnection of everything, from allergies to diet to workouts to that ultimate stress reducer,&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href="https://mashable.com/category/mindfulness" href="https://mashable.com/category/mindfulness" target="_blank">mindfulness</a>. Summaries of my answers appeared on screen, not yet written by AI, but by trained medical scribes listening in remotely. At first that seemed slightly creepy, but I soon saw the point: For the first time in my medical life, a physician didn’t have to spend half his time playing stenographer in a secret file. We were both on the same virtual page.</p><p>Most of my vital signs for the last decade were already on the screen when we began, since I’d granted access to my Apple Health app. My genome would follow after I downloaded the raw data from&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href="https://mashable.com/roundup/which-dna-test-is-best-ancestry-23-and-me" href="https://mashable.com/roundup/which-dna-test-is-best-ancestry-23-and-me" target="_blank">23andMe</a>. Analysis of a blood draw appeared in just 12 minutes; its 75 biomarkers revealed internal organs in robust good health (only my fasting glucose was a little elevated; something to keep an eye on, given a family history of diabetes). The next visit would do a deep dive on genetics; the one after that would test me for the top five most deadly cancers. In-between, there would be some gentle nudging and nagging via the Forward app, as my doctor saw new at-home readings from my Bluetooth scales or blood pressure monitor.</p><p>So yes, maybe this is a 22nd century healthcare experience. Or maybe it just looks that way because healthcare in 2021 is so far behind where it should be. Most of us are carrying around smartphones that know more about us than our doctors do, and most of our doctors don’t even think to sync up with the phone data, or to get this deep into the weeds of preventative medicine. “People walk into our exam room and go “oh my god, I’ve seen the future,” says Adrian Aoun, the founder and CEO of Forward Health. “I’m like, ‘you know, they have touchscreens in McDonald\'s. It’s just that you didn’t see the past.’”</p><p>In fact, our antiquated healthcare system is such an embarrassment that I’m almost reluctant to discuss it — except for the fact that you may well be struggling with the same legacy problems, even eight decades hence. After all, it’s been nearly eight decades since a U.S. president first tried to pass a universal healthcare law, only to run into a buzzsaw of special interests.&nbsp;</p><p>All those incremental legislative victories since, all that trench warfare against the same “socialized medicine” boogeymen, and what have we achieved? There were more than 29 million Americans without health insurance in 2019, compared to 28 million in 2018.

And as much as I adore having been born into a universal healthcare system that will bankrupt no one, the UK’s beloved National Health Service (NHS), its recent&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href="https://nhsfunding.info/nhs-crisis-making/" href="https://nhsfunding.info/nhs-crisis-making/" target="_blank">underfunding</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/mar/11/nhs-england-waiting-times-reached-record-high-in-january" href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/mar/11/nhs-england-waiting-times-reached-record-high-in-january" target="_blank">record wait times</a>&nbsp;aren’t much to boast about either.</p><p>But slowly, quietly, on both sides of the Atlantic, a technological revolution in preventative care is underway — one that may slash healthcare spending and usher in a truly universal, actually 22nd century-style wellness regime for everyone.

Forward’s primary care services cost $149 a month, on top of any other insurance you might have, and are currently only available to the usual suspects, the well-heeled citizens of LA, New York, Chicago, SF, and Washington, D.C.&nbsp;</p><p><iframe frameborder="0" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/_h8QvIoSTsE" width="640" height="360" class="note-video-clip"></iframe><br></p><p>Those of us who worry about a two-tier 22nd century healthcare system, with a sparkling, polished, cancer-vaccinated, gene-edited elite on the one hand and a vast brink-of-bankruptcy underclass on the other, will find much to fear here.<br></p><p>On the other hand, maybe it’s exactly the sort of company we need to help cure America’s addiction to spending on sickness treatment (expected to reach $5.4 trillion, or 20 percent of U.S. GDP, in 2024). Maybe Forward and its ilk can disrupt this $11 trillion industry by being the smartphones of healthcare — getting the masses hooked on treating their health like a video game where the object is to have as few troubling biomarkers as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>The $149 a month cost may be expensive now (though it is the same as Medicare Part B, the government insurance we fantasize about making available to everyone, which, in addition to general medical services like diagnostics and ambulances, covers only one major preventative visit per year and one screening for the country’s biggest killer, cardiovascular disease, every five years). That’s the company’s business plan, to keep expanding and driving down the cost and adding more services, like its new purpose-built skin cancer scanner, until the cost plummets well below monthly premiums.</p><p>“I want to keep going until Forward is as close to zero fucking dollars as possible,” says Aoun. “That’s not a joke. Not a euphemism. Literally, I would like to charge $0. And we want to keep adding value until we’ve built out the entire healthcare system.”</p><p>If preventative care becomes a big enough deal that it eases pressure off the hospital system, then the massive subsidies we’re already spending on healthcare may be able to cover more costs. Insurance premiums, Medicare included, may plummet if they only have to cover the truly unavoidable, like accidents and rare diseases. More preventive care means fewer people on long-term drug regimens. Shorn of big payouts, Big Pharma may be forced to actually innovate again, focusing on&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href="https://mashable.com/feature/smart-drugs-future-brain" href="https://mashable.com/feature/smart-drugs-future-brain" target="_blank">smarter drugs and next-generation brain-stimulation tech</a>.

The threat of genetic discrimination, like racial discrimination, looms large in many walks of life.</p><p>But if any iniquity can make a majority of the U.S. Congress finally, properly bring the health industry and its rapacious cost curve to heel, genetic discrimination will be it. By the time you arrive, 80 years in our future, Americans may finally have what we could have had for the past 80 years: Genuinely universal healthcare, prevention-focused and treated as a human right, for as close to zero fucking dollars out of pocket as possible.</p>', 'Life', '["healthcare", "health tech"]', 'https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1634655%252F29277142-111d-4a75-8a24-39f3ab2602df.jpg%252Foriginal.jpg?signature=gd_d7jtcG7eyW6tHjtjkLBjADs0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com', '2021-07-23 06:19:43'),
